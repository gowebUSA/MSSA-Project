### Test Status and Test Readiness Review (TRR)
Continuing with the implementation phase of the SDLC, and using Test Driven Development (TDD) leads to a pattern of recursive test-fix-test activities.

This week (5/11/2020), update your test report to show your updated (decomposed) requirements, and indicating which have been implemented, tested, passing (and when), or failing, and method of test.

### Answer the following:

- What percent of requirements are (currently) covered by test cases?
    * Test were done using the instructions on [Intertech](https://www.intertech.com/Blog/unit-test-net-entity-validation/).
    * There are total of 20 test from the original [RTM](https://github.com/gowebUSA/MSSA-Project/blob/master/TSQL/Project-Step-7/Requirement%20List%20and%20RTM.pdf) but only 9 are implementable.
    * 
- What percent of test cases are currently passing?
- What level of Validation could be expected after Verification? (Acceptance Tests?) And
- Include itemized test list
- Include RTM
