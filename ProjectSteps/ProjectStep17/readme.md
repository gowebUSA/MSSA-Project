### Test Status and Test Readiness Review (TRR)
Continuing with the implementation phase of the SDLC, and using Test Driven Development (TDD) leads to a pattern of recursive test-fix-test activities.

This week (5/11/2020), update your test report to show your updated (decomposed) requirements, and indicating which have been implemented, tested, passing (and when), or failing, and method of test.

### Answer the following:

- What percent of requirements are (currently) covered by test cases?
- What percent of test cases are currently passing?
- What level of Validation could be expected after Verification? (Acceptance Tests?) And
- Include itemized test list
- Include RTM

### Submit:

URL for your project repository (Github) and location of test status report,
