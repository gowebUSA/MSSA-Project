# Project Step 15 - Preliminary Product Delivery

## Sprint Review / Demo / MVP

Agile software development methodologies encourage short delivery cycles of smaller deliverables compared with the traditional waterfall approach which targets a single, completed project through sequential evolutionary phases.

In scrum methodology, these shorter cycles, termed 'Sprints' allow flexible scope and fix cost and budget.

A goal of every sprint in the product evolution is a tested, **potentially shippable product**. The concept of a minimum viable product (MVP) is a functional subset of feature requirements, suitable for stakeholder review and feedback.

For this project step, define or describe the next minimum viable product for this Sprint. In the Github form "Create a New Project" plan the next phase (sprint) of your project, giving it a consistent title according to your naming conventions (could be "Sprint 2") and add your target deliverable (MVP) in the description box in the form.

### Submit

At the end of the (1 week) sprint, submit the Sprint Review like last week with additional screenshots or suitable presentation artifacts to support the Demo of your MVP.
