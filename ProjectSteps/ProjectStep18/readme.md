4.  Lessons learned:
    * What did you do right?
      * Chosing the right design and platform makes a huge difference on making you project goes smoothly.
      * Using GitHub as my project management tool gave me the ability to see the big picture and detailed task required to make the project come to life.
    * What did you do wrong?
      * Thinking too much on the design part will make some of your implemenation not do-able.
    * Where were you lucky?
      * By using Microsoft Excel to implement my form design using CSS mso schemes. At first, it was not showing the way I wanted to but when I figured out that the stylesheet.css was not publish correctly, I was able to correct it and my form work fine. I thought that the css mso schemes will not work because it was giving me warnings on VS.
    * What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
      * By knowing PowerShell made programming easier specially for migrating database context.
