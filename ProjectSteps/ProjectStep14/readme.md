# Project Step 14 - Sprint Execution And Review

## Sprint Execution And Review
Correctly planning and executing to a sprint plan is essential to tracking progress for the agile software development process. Product Backlog Items (PBIs) may be sourced from internal as well as external stakeholders but backlog grooming is the product owner's responsibility. The scrum team commits to how many of the highest priority items that they can accomplish during the sprint and, as a team, completes those items one-by-one. At the end of the sprint, the scrum team presents their results to the stakeholders for feedback, project support, and potential requirements change.

This week, execute to your project list, each day moving items from your todo list, to Work-in-progress (WIP) and finally to 'complete'.

### Submit: 
1. Daily screenshots Each day take a screenshot of the [Kanban issue board](https://github.com/gowebUSA/MSSA-Project/projects/2). At the end of the sprint, submit your daily screenshots.
   * Day 1

2. Burndown chart (what is a burndown chart?) There are many sprint tracking tools available. Github is convenient because you can track all elements of your project together, but it doesn't support burndown charts yet. Use any tool to show what a burndown chart of your sprint might look like.
   * You can download the **[Burndown Chart here dtd 200427](https://github.com/gowebUSA/MSSA-Project/blob/master/ProjectSteps/ProjectStep14/images/Sprint_Burndown_Chart_OMAF_200427.xlsx?raw=true)**.

3. Sprint Review Answer the following:
   * Did you complete all items in your sprint plan?
      * No.
   * What is your sprint deliverable? (shippable product(s))
      * Yes, you can visit the live website at https://omaf.azurewebsites.net/
   * Did you have any task volatility, and what was the cause?
      * Yes, skipping days because of other priorities.
      * And researching tools for implementation of additional functionality for the project.
   * What would you do differently knowing what you know now?
      * I would start my project using the project management tools provided by GitHub.
   
4. (Next) Sprint Plan Create another 'project' (may be named "[Project Step 14a](https://github.com/gowebUSA/MSSA-Project/projects/3)") and add items from your prioritized backlog issues. Attach a screenshot of the new Kanban board (sprint plan).
