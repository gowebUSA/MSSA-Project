# Project Step 13 - Sprint Planning
## Ready for review:

### Step 1. 
From the Issues tab in Github, add a new issue. A well constructed issue should contain:

1. A user story. This is not always going to be the system user. This is meant to provide clarification and context to the assigned engineer.
2. Acceptance criteria. Clarify the objectives of the issue. Know when it's done.
3. Additional supporting information such as diagrams, descriptions, screen captures, error messages, etc.. to assist the developer with reproducing the error, or linking to pre-existing designs.
- (Optional) Milestone description if this is targetted to a particular build or document or subcomponent or phase
- (Optional) Any relevant labels such as (defect) Severity or (issue) Priority see notes below
note... add tasks to the issue by starting the entry with "- [ ]" or "- [x]"

You should have at least 15 (probably more) items on your backlog list.

### Step 2. 
Create a project board from your repository (can be Sprint 1, Sprint 2, ...) and add prioritized issues from your backlog. Decide how many you will complete during the Sprint. Move the issues across the columns from +To Do (Planned)

- In Progress (WIP) .. to
- Done (Complete)

You will likely not want to have more than 2 or 3 active issues "In Progress" at a time.

### Step 3. 
Submit (3) screenshots of the (a.) Issues list, the opened (b.)Issue Details for one of the project issues, and (c.) the current active project bpard showing the planned sprint items.

Finally, paste the link to your [Github project page](https://github.com/gowebUSA/MSSA-Project) in the comments box to indicate that the assignmetn is ready for review.
